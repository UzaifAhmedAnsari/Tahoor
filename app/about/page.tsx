                    As we state on our <Link href="/rates" className="font-semibold italic text-[#ef7a2e] hover:underline">Rates</Link> page,
                    these hunts are not for everyone. The elements of age, physical fitness, weather, wing shooting,
                    dog handling, dog training and pack hunting mentality are some of the skills tested as hunters
                    enter fields in the ultimate fair chase pheasant hunting test.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-3">
                    We are not a preserve or hunt club and these birds are not raised in pens and released in our
                    fields. They are naturally produced on our habitat and this is the ultimate fair chase pheasant
                    hunting. Other elements that factor into the fair chase equation are seasonal weather and crop
                    harvest progress.

                  <p>
                    Another frequent question we get from hunters is, “If I have my own dogs, know how to hunt and I just
                    need a map and some directions, can I be left alone to hunt the way I want to hunt?” This also was part
                    of the UGUIDE <Link href="/quote-reserve" className="font-semibold italic text-[#ef7a2e] hover:underline">unguided pheasant hunting</Link> founding philosophy.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-3">
                    You get a map and tour of the property by the landowner and are left to the challenge of fair chase
                    roosters for the balance of your stay. You against the roosters. The way <Link href="/quote-reserve" className="font-semibold italic text-[#ef7a2e] hover:underline">self guided pheasant hunting</Link> was meant to be.

                    3) Shooting Skills, 4) Hunting Strategy Skills, 5) Teamwork. People ask me, “Do you guide?” and I
                    respond, “No, U-Guide”.

                <DifferenceCard title='5 - The Pheasant "Camp" Experience'>
                  <p>
                    Having grown up hunting whitetails in Minnesota and Wisconsin and pheasants in Iowa for 20 years staying
                    in motels and hunting public, I became introduced to the very special camp tradition those states hold.
                    The “Camp” type experience was built into the UGUIDE system by following the principles above.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-3">
                    That translates to your group, your lodging, your land and your special unique experience. In South Dakota,
                    hunting fair chase pheasants combines all the unpredictable factors that make the experience special and
                    unique like farming, weather, natural production, hunting pressure, dog skills, hunter skills, shooting
                    skills and the journey to get to your destination.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-3">
                    One of the greatest benefits many hunters talk about experiencing while at a UGUIDE pheasant Camp is
                    “Camaraderie”. I can assure you, nowhere else will the wily roosters of South Dakota be more challenging
                    and worthy of chase.

                  <p>
                    Wild-Reared Ring-necks Only! Hunters that come the distances they do from all over the country are
                    obviously concerned about being able to hunt fair chase. We get asked the question all the time,
                    “Do you release pheasants?” Our response is always the same, “No”.

                  <p className="mt-3">
                    We never have and never will. My question is: why would anyone want to come to South Dakota to shoot a pen
                    raised pheasant when they can do that much cheaper at their hometown area hunt club? The UGUIDE difference
                    is high natural production through well managed <Link href="/about" className="font-semibold italic text-[#ef7a2e] hover:underline">habitat</Link>, farms and annual pheasant life-cycles.

                  <p>
                    Many times hunters will ask, “Will we be combined with any other hunters?” We prefer to hunt with our own
                    group. From the start, one of the founding principles of UGUIDE was that each group or party had its own
                    style and culture of hunting and therefore combining groups was never a good idea.

                <DifferenceCard title='6 - The "Coop" Owners Model'>
                  <p>
                    In the early years of UGUIDE, it became very apparent that lodging was required in conjunction with the land
                    to complete the fair chase pheasant hunting experience. Essentially hunters just needed a “place to stay” and
                    did not want to pay a lot for lodging. For this reason, it became important for the landowner/outfitter to
                    also provide the lodging in association with their hunting offering.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mt-3">
                    The top requirement for hunters was to have access to high quality habitat that held only naturally produced
                    birds. The lodging was provided out of necessity. Now keep in mind that all of these UGUIDE camps are run by
                    full time producer farmers and ranchers.
